            <h4> History of The Franciscan Brethren of Saint Philip, Inc.</h4>
            <p>
                The Franciscan Brethren of Saint Philip Inc., 
                is a network of religious including the Little Sisters of Saint Francis,
                Sisters of Saint Joseph, Sisters of Divine Mercy,
                Carmelites, Bene Maria Sisters and Brothers of Charles Lwanga
                who have ministered to the marginalized special needs adults 
                since 1999. These dedicated women and men offer individuals 
                with profound intellectual or physical challenges a congregate 
                living arrangement limited to a small group of adults with 
                recognized developmental disabilities. Individuals receive 
                primary care which is comprised of room, board, and general
                supervision. In addition, they receive assistance training and 
                specialized supervision according to their individual support 
                needs and preferences. Each resident is encouraged to be as 
                independent as possible with daily living activities to achieve 
                an improved quality of life through integration in community 
                activities.

            Mother Mary Kevin Kearney, a diminutive nun from Ireland who had
            a strong desire to serve God and the needy throughout the world, 
            founded the Little Sisters of Saint Francis of Assisi in Uganda on
            May 21, 1923. Mother Kevin witnessed the subjugation and servitude of
            the African girl and was inspired by the Holy Spirit to found the
            Institute of Little Sisters of Saint Francis to uplift the status
            of fellow women. Her vision for the Little Sisters was that they be
            well educated women dedicated to the promotion an empowerment of
            the poor and underprivileged, with an emphasis on serving women.
            Today the order has 700 professed members of the Little Sisters of
            Saint Francis.  The Institute’s Motherhouse and first Novitiate are
            located in Nkokonjeru, Uganda, in the Diocese of Lugazi. Little 
            Sisters of Saint Francis are committed to reaching out to the vulnerable
            members of the community in love and service. Care of the elderly is 
            not only service but their charism.
